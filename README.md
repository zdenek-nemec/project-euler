Zdenek versus Project Euler

My solutions for Project Euler problems. Visit https://projecteuler.net/ for more information about the Project Euler.

Requirements for a complete solution:
* A problem has its own directory.
* The solution script can be run and displays only the result, which is accepted on Project Euler site.
* There are unit tests with at least parameterized test for Solution.solve() method.
* Solution passes all tests.
* Python 3 is used and is specified on the first line of the solution script.
* Sphinx documentation can be generated without errors and does not contain any issues.
* There is a complete header within the solution script containing author, version and description.
* There is a class Solution with method solve().
* The main() calls Solution.solve() with constants.
* All names (variables, classes, methods, ...) are self-explanatory and do not contain abbreviations.
* There are no code-check warnings from PyCharm.
* No line exceeds 80 characters.
* Classes and methods are sorted alphabetically.
* Line endings are CRLF.
