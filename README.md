# Project Euler

Zdenek versus Project Euler

Zdenek's solutions for Project Euler problems. Visit [https://projecteuler.net/](https://projecteuler.net/) for more information about the Project Euler.

## Definition of Done

* Python 3.8 is used.
* The problem has its own directory, e.g. `project-euler/problems_0xx/pep001_multiples_of_3_and_5/pep001.py`.
* Encoding is UTF-8 and line endings are CRLF.
* The solution class, e.g. `ProjectEulerProblem001()`, has `__init__()` and `solve()` methods.
* The inputs for solution are saved as private variables in `__init__()` method.
* The method `solve()` returns only the solution accepted by Project Euler site.
* The script has constants which are passed as inputs to the solution class.
* The script check if it is the main running script. In that case displays the solution.
* Double quotes character `"` is the default for the strings.
* All names (variables, classes, methods, ...) are self-explanatory and do not contain unnecessary abbreviations.
* Long statements are split amongst multiple lines with logical operator at the start of the line.
* Closing parentheses are at the end of the last line of the block.
* Static methods are avoided if possible.
* There are no code-check warnings from PyCharm.
* ~~No line exceeds 79 characters.~~
* The script can be run.
* Unit tests, e.g. `test_pep001.py`, are implemented and utilise expected and actual variables.
* Unit tests have at least one parameterized test for the solution.
* The solution passes all the unit tests.
* Running test script executes all implemented unit tests.
* The header within the solution script contains complete description of the problem.
* ~~Sphinx documentation is generated without errors and does not contain any issues.~~
