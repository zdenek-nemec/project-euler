Zdenek versus Project Euler

My solutions for Project Euler problems. Visit https://projecteuler.net/ for more information about the Project Euler.

Requirements for a complete solution:
* The problem has its own directory.
* The solution script can be run and displays only the result, which is accepted on the Project Euler site.
* Python 3 is used and is specified on the first line of the solution script.
* The header within the solution script contains complete description of the problem.
* There is a class Solution() with method solve().
* The main() calls Solution().solve() with constants.
* All names (variables, classes, methods, ...) are self-explanatory and do not contain abbreviations.
* There are no code-check warnings from PyCharm and no line exceeds 80 characters.
* Apostrophe (') is the default for the strings, not double quotes (").
* Long if statements are in parentheses with logical operator at the end of the line.
* Classes and methods are sorted alphabetically.
* Line endings are CRLF.
* Unit tests have at least a parameterized test for Solution().solve() method.
* The solution passes all the unit tests.
* Sphinx documentation can be generated without errors and does not contain any issues.
